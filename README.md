What is this?
 - This is a heavily optimized and multithreaded implementation of a basic pagerank algorithm created for a university project for SOFT3410.
 - The project demonstrates my understanding of parallel programming, and my ability to utilize the OpenMP API.
 
Important to note:
 - The header file and main method were NOT written by me. These were provided as code stubs from SOFT3410.

How to use the makefile:
	- To just compile the code, run make pagerank
	- To clean the directory, run make clean
	- To run the benchmarker, run make benchmark
		- The benchmarker is a simply bash script provided that will run time on the time to complete all diffs
		- of the provided tests in the tests folder
